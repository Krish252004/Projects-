# Personal Assistant Speech Recognition System
This project is a PC-based personal assistant that leverages speech recognition to execute commands and perform tasks based on voice input. Designed to enhance user interaction with the computer, this system makes it possible to control various aspects of the PC hands-free, making it an efficient tool for productivity and accessibility.


# Key Features:
# Voice Command Execution: 
Understands and executes a wide range of voice commands, allowing users to interact with their computer using natural language.
# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm:
Utilizes the KNN algorithm for classifying and processing spoken commands, ensuring accurate recognition and response.
# Customizable Command Set:
Users can easily expand the system by adding new voice commands and corresponding actions.
# Technologies Used:
# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm: 
Employed for its simplicity and effectiveness in pattern recognition, particularly in matching spoken phrases to predefined commands.
# Python:
Core programming language used for implementing the system.
# Speech Recognition Libraries: 
Integrated to capture and process voice input.
# Applications:
# Task Automation:
Automate routine tasks such as opening applications, browsing the web, or controlling system settings.
# Accessibility Support: 
Provide an alternative interface for users with physical disabilities or those who prefer voice interaction.
